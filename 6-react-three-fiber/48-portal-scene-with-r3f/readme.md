# 48 - Portal scene with r3f

This time, we are going to recreate the portal scene.

## Colors

By default, R3F sets a `toneMapping`.

This toneMapping is usually welcome and colors look better with it.
However, we donâ€™t want it because our scene has been baked from Blender which has already applied
tone mapping with its color management system.

To disable the default `toneMapping`, use:

```jsx
<Canvas flat>
  ...
</Canvas>
```

## Drei helpers

Don't forget to take advantages of [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) helpers.

It has many helpers, for example a helper for the
[floating glowing particles](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei?tab=readme-ov-file#sparkles)
or the [shaders](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei?tab=readme-ov-file#shadermaterial).
